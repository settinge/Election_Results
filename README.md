# Python-Challenge_1

# How to Run Code

1. Clone repository to a folder on your machine

2. Open repository in code source editor

3. Navigate to PyBank>Main_Edits.py and PyPoll>VsCode.py

4. Run both scripts

 PyBank:

 The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  * In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
